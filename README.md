# [Boxodoro](https://boxodoro.com)

Boxodoro is a simple timer for the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) of working 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break.

It starts automatically and snaps to the hour. The alarm sounds at 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 55 minutes, and the end of every hour. This is useful for adhering to a schedule (such as when [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)) as you'll never have a Pomodoro run into the next block of time.
